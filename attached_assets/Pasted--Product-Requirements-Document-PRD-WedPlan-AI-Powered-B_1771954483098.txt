# **WedPlan**

**AI-Powered Budget Builder & True Cost Tracker for DIY Weddings**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**WedPlan** is an AI-powered financial planning platform for U.S. couples who are considering hiring a wedding planner but want to confidently plan their wedding themselves.

Most couples don’t hire planners because they lack taste or organization — they hire planners because they lack financial clarity. Wedding pricing is fragmented, opaque, and filled with hidden costs. Quotes are hard to compare. Budget spreadsheets quickly become outdated. Small overruns snowball into five-figure surprises.

WedPlan solves this by becoming the **financial intelligence layer** of the wedding:

* Builds a realistic starting budget
* Tracks spending in real time
* Normalizes vendor proposals into true all-in costs
* Flags overruns early
* Suggests smart trade-offs

WedPlan gives couples the confidence of a planner — without paying $8K–$15K for one.

## 2. Market Context

### The U.S. Wedding Market

* ~2M weddings annually in the U.S.
* Average cost: ~$30K–$45K nationally (higher in major cities)
* Planner fees: $5K–$20K depending on service level
* Majority of couples attempt DIY or partial planning

### Current Solutions

* Google Sheets / Excel
* Static budget templates (The Knot, Zola)
* Full-service planners
* Venue coordinators (limited scope)

### Gap in the Market

Existing tools:

* Provide static budget templates
* Do not account for regional variation
* Do not extract vendor quote details
* Do not normalize hidden fees
* Do not provide real-time financial forecasting
* Do not suggest trade-offs

There is no tool that acts as:

> “Your AI wedding CFO.”

WedPlan fills that gap.

## 3. Target Customer

### Primary Persona: The Financially Anxious DIY Couple

* U.S.-based
* Budget range: $50K–$200K
* Guest count: 100–250
* Likely urban or suburban
* Professional, spreadsheet-literate
* Debating whether to hire a planner

### Psychological Profile

* Overwhelmed but detail-oriented
* Wants control
* Nervous about hidden costs
* Feels vendor proposals are confusing
* Doesn’t trust “starting at” pricing

### Emotional Trigger

“I don’t want to regret overspending — but I also don’t want to cheap out.”

WedPlan reduces that anxiety.

2. **Real-Time Cost Tracking**
3. **True Cost Quote Normalizer (AI-powered)**
4. **Trade-Off & Risk Alert Engine**

# FEATURE 1: Smart Budget Builder

---

## 5. Problem

Couples start with:

* Arbitrary total budgets (e.g., “$80K sounds reasonable”)
* Pinterest inspiration disconnected from pricing reality
* No understanding of cost per guest
* No regional pricing adjustments

This creates immediate budget distortion.

---

## 6. Solution: Dynamic Budget Modeling

WedPlan generates a realistic, location-adjusted, guest-count-driven budget.

### Inputs:

* Wedding location (city/state)
* Guest count
* Venue type
* Season
* Style level (Budget / Mid-range / Premium / Luxury)
* Top 3 priorities (e.g., food, photography, florals)

### Outputs:

* Category allocation percentages
* Dollar ranges (low–high realistic)
* Per-guest cost projections
* Recommended contingency buffer (10–15%)

---

## 7. Budget Dashboard

### Main View Includes:

* Total Target Budget
* Committed Spend
* Pending Quotes
* Remaining Budget
* Contingency Remaining
* Risk Score (Low / Moderate / High)

### Category View Includes:

---

## 8. Real-Time Cost Tracking

Users can:

* Add vendor
* Upload proposal
* Enter deposits
* Mark contract signed
* Track payment schedule

System automatically:

* Updates totals
* Tracks cash flow timeline
* Flags when a category exceeds recommended allocation

---

# FEATURE 2: True Cost Quote Normalizer

---

## 9. Problem

Vendor proposals:

* Come in PDFs, emails, or custom formats
* Hide fees in footnotes
* Exclude taxes or gratuity
* Omit overtime or rental breakdown fees
* Structure pricing differently across vendors

Couples cannot compare fairly.

---

## 10. Solution: AI-Powered Proposal Extraction

Users upload:

* PDFs
* Screenshots
* Email threads
* Catering menus
* Floral proposals

AI extracts:

* Line items
* Labor
* Rentals
* Service charges
* Admin fees
* Delivery/setup
* Travel
* Overtime policies
* Taxes

---

## 11. “True All-In Cost” Calculation

WedPlan calculates:

* Base price
* Mandatory service charges
* Estimated tax (by location)
* Rental add-ons
* Conditional overtime assumptions
* Gratuity norms (optional but transparent)

Then outputs:

### TRUE ALL-IN COST

Example:

| Vendor    | Base    | Fees   | Tax    | Hidden Risk   | True Cost |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------------- | --------- |
| Caterer A | $28,000 | $6,200 | $3,100 | Overtime risk | $37,300   |

This makes vendor comparisons objective.

---

## 12. Hidden Fee Detection

WedPlan flags:

* “Service charge not equal to gratuity”
* “Labor not included in floral install”
* “Sound equipment not included”
* “Delivery calculated per mile”
* “Venue requires approved rental vendor”

This mimics planner-level financial scrutiny.

---

# FEATURE 3: Trade-Off & Risk Engine

---

## 13. Overrun Detection

If catering exceeds target by $10K:

WedPlan suggests:
